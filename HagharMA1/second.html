        The Nike Air Force 1 ‘07 Craft ‘Mantra Orange’ presents a simple two-tone colorway
         of the vintage silhouette originally made for the hardwood. 
         The sneaker’s off-white tumbled leather upper is accented with 
         dark orange suede detailing on the Swoosh and heel tab, the latter
          affixed with a discreet AF1 tab in the same autumnal hue.
           In keeping with the shoe’s performance origins, the midsole
            houses Nike Air sole cushioning in the heel, while the rubber
             outsole features a pivot-ready traction pattern.

    <div class="text">
        The Nike OverBreak SP ‘College Grey’ showcases subdued
        neutral tones on a retro-inspired silhouette that blends 
        old and new, featuring details borrowed from both the Daybreak
        and OverReact. Multicolor laces secure an upper constructed
        from lightweight textile with synthetic suede overlays.
        A woven tongue tag and oversized Swoosh contribute to
        the sneaker’s heritage aesthetic. Responsive cushioning
        comes courtesy of a Nike React midsole, supported underfoot
        by durable rubber in high-wear areas.

    <div class="text">
        The Off-White x Air Max 97 ‘Menta’ features a translucent textile upper finished 
        in Wolf Grey, complemented by Virgil Abloh’s signature text and tonal zigzag 
        stitching throughout. The neutral color scheme is disrupted by a multicolored 
        Swoosh that transitions from green to blue to red, while underfoot, a smoky 
        grey rubber outsole maintains the shoe’s translucent theme.

        Made in collaboration with Ben & Jerry’s, the Nike Dunk Low SB ‘Chunky Dunky’ 
        replicates the packaging used for the ice cream brand’s Chunky Monkey flavor. 
        The leather upper depicts blue skies and green pastures, while pony-hair overlays 
        are rendered in a spotted cow print. A yellow leather Swoosh is 
        treated to a melting ice cream effect for added visual flair. 
        Atop the tongue, the woven tag features a Chunky Dunky callout 
        alongside Nike SB branding.

    <div class="text">
        The Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Retro High features a new look on the iconic 
        silhouette, thanks to an oversized backward-facing Swoosh on the 
        lateral side. A traditionally oriented Swoosh graces the medial 
        side of the upper, which is built with a blend of white leather 
        and brown suede. Additional unique details include a double-layer 
        construction on the collar and Scott’s crudely drawn face logo 
        embossed on the heel.

    <div class="text">
        The Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG is a work of nostalgia, modernizing 
        the 1985 icon's distinctive elements to honor Michael Jordan's 
        legendary career arc. Debuted in August 2019, this 'Obsidian' 
        version tributes MJ's college alma mater through a team-inspired, 
        color block palette on the leather upper. Matching branding notes 
        and Swooshes play their part in the homage. The Nike Air infused 
        midsole and circular rubber outsole supply classic comfort and traction.

        <img src="images/Volt.jpg" alt="AirJordan1 Volt Shoes" width="150">
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        The Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG ‘Volt Gold’ gives the iconic model a subtle 
        makeover that takes its design cues from previous Air Jordan 1 
        colorways. Unique details include a reversed translucent tag on 
        an exposed foam tongue and detached collar flaps in an 
        eye-catching shade of Volt. The rest of the leather upper is 
        rendered in tri-tonal color blocking, featuring a crisp white 
        base with contrasting black forefoot overlays and a heel panel 
        in University Gold.

    <div class="text">
        Released in early 2020, the Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG 'Pine Green 2.0' comes in 
        a simple colorway of Pine Green and Gym Red on a black template. When Peter Moore 
        designed the first Air Jordan in 1985, he wanted to provide support for the dynamic 
        superstar with the freakishly athletic game—without sacrificing comfort. He designed 
        a high-top shoe with durable leather featuring upper eyelet straps, heel and midfoot 
        overlays, and a perforated toebox. The history of flight had begun.
